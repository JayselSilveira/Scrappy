Scrappy is a game for one player where you can fly a helicopter through a maze of obstacles. The game is quite easy to operate and requires almost no skills at all. You can navigate up through the game by using a space bar and leave the same to move down. All you got to do is dodge the obstacles. You lose if you crash. Hope you enjoy!!
